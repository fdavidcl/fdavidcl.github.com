Deep learning is a branch of machine learning dedicated to algorithms which find abstractions or partial representations of data through multiple layers of neurons or other complex structures.

Developed software:

* [Ruta](http://fdavidcl.me/ruta/), an early-stage R package for training unsupervised deep learning techniques such as autoencoders
* [Rutavis](http://github.com/fdavidcl/rutavis), a companion package for visualizations
